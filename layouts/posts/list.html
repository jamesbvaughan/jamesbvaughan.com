    RSS is awesome.
    It's a protocol that lets you subscribe to sites like this
    that publish content that can be represented as a feed.
    In order to use RSS, you'll need an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators">RSS reader</a>.
    I like to follow things with RSS reader because it lets
    me see all of the feeds I subscribe to in one place,
    in a consistent format,
    with fewer distractions,
    and without an algorithm telling me which articles and blog
    posts I should like.
    RSS isn't perfect,
    but I think it's the best widely-available solution
    for keeping up with content creators that I like.
