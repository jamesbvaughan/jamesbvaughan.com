      <description>I read a lot of blog posts and articles online, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite mediums for reading and writing. I generally discover new blogs through Reddit or Hacker News, and when I read something that I like, I&amp;rsquo;ll usually add it to my RSS reader so that I can keep up with new posts.
I often see people romanticizing the blogging culture of the late-90s/early-2000s internet, and I don&amp;rsquo;t doubt that we could be missing some things from that time, but I think that today&amp;rsquo;s blogging culture is alive and well.</description>

      <description>I watch a lot of movies. If you want to track every single movie I watch, you can do that on my Letterboxd profile. If you are just interested in knowing what my favorite movies are, then you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place.
My favorite movies I&amp;rsquo;d like to preface this section by saying that I make a distinction between what I believe to be the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; movies and what are my &amp;ldquo;favorite&amp;rdquo; movies.</description>

      <description>I think podcasts are really cool. You can listen to them and learn or be entertained or both in a lot of situations where you can&amp;rsquo;t easily read a book or do real work. I spend a lot of time walking, which makes for a lot of time to listen to podcasts.
My favorite podcasts I try to maintain a balance of podcasts that teach me new and interesting things and podcasts that are mostly entertainment.</description>
