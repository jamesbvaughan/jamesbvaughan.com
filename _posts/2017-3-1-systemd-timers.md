title: Systemd Timers as a Cron Alternative
---

I recently gave a short talk at the UCLA Linux User Group
about Systemd Timers and how they can be used as an alternative
to Cron jobs.

If you're interested in a quick introduction to Systemd Timers,
please take a look at
[the slides]({{ site.url }}/systemd-timers-presentation)
or
