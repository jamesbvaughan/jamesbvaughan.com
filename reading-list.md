title: Reading List
---

I used to read books all the time in Jr. High and High School,
but whenI started college,
I stopped reading for myself as much as my readings and homework
for classes started to pile up.
Recently, I have been reading for myself a lot more frequently and I am going to
use this page as a log of the books that I read.
