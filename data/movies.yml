    Rian Johnson's The Brothers Bloom is a nearly-perfect movie.
    It has a fantastic cast,
    a brilliant script with a nice blend of comedy, adventure, drama, and
    suspense, great music and visuals, and is just overall very charming.

    I really enjoy Alfred Hitchcock's movies, and Vertigo is without a doubt
    my favorite one.

    I am not genrally a fan of horror movies, but I love this one.
    It's a French horror-drama set in a veterinary school and I don't want to
    tell you any more than that.

    It always surprises me that this movie didn't get more popular.
    The pacing and fantastic performances help to build a level of suspense
    that very few movies that I've seen have been able to achieve.
