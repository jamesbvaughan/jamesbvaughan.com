    The Bike Shed is produced by Thoughtbot and covers all things related to
    software engineering, often with a focus on Ruby on Rails, but definitely
    not exclusively Ruby on Rails.

    Each episode of this podcast features a different band or artist breaking
    down one of their songs.
    The topics vary a lot, with some artists talking mostly about the lyrics
    and how they came up with the story in the song, and others focusing on the
    technical details of how they created all the sounds in the song.

    This is a relatively new podcast from the old host of The Bike Shed and it
    feels very similar.
    I've found that even if I'm unfamiliar with the topic of an episode,
    I usually find it really interesting just to listen and learn about it.

    I found this one on
    [Devon Zuegel's list of recommended podcasts](http://devonzuegel.com/post/podcast-audiobook-starter-kit)
    where she describes it as "the best interview show out there".
    Topics range from economics and politics to psychedelic drugs.

    This was probably the first podcast that I listened to on the topic of
    software development.
    It has some really great interviews with the creators and maintainers of
    some of the biggest and most widely used open source projects.

    This is a new one for me and I've only listened to a few episodes,
    but I really like it so far.
    In it, Shane Parrish interviews a wide variety of people, exploring
    "the ideas, methods, and mental models, that help expand your mind,
    live deliberately, and master the best of what other people have
    already figured out."

    People have been recommending this podcast to me for a long time, but I
    only recently started listening to it.
    It feels slightly more like entertainment than useful education,
    but can have some really interesting topics,
    and the episodes are usually pretty short, which is nice for times when I
    don't have enough time for a long podcast.
