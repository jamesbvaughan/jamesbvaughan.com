# Introduction

This week's interview is featuring Jay Kamat
([jgkamat](https://github.com/jgkamat)).
Jay is a student studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech.
I first heard about Jay through his work on [Qutebrowser](qutebrowser)
and was really impressed with how much work he had done on the browser and
with how welcoming and helpful he was in the Github issues and on IRC.
When I found out that he and I were the same age,
I thought he would be a perfect person to feature in this series.

books, videos, podcasts, etc. that made an impact on them recently.
These recommendations may be related to open source software, to software
engineering in general, or completely unrelated to computers._
