I'm not great at picking gifts for people.
Don't get me wrong, I love _giving_ gifts,
and I often see things in stores or online and think
"That would make a great gift for (Amanda, Kyle, my dad, etc.)!",
but when it comes time to pick a gift for a specific person,
I draw a blank, either unable to think of options that I am happy with
or unable to choose from a set of options without seriously overthinking
the decision.

Lately, I have started doing two things that have helped me improve my
gifting skills:
1. I now keep gift idea lists for people that I am close with and add any items
I come across to this lists that I think would make good gifts.
2. I opt to _make_ gifts for people rather than _purchase_ gifts for people.

The more I choose to make gifts instead of purchase them,
the more I'm beginning to prefer see it as the superior option.
Not only does it usually cost less than buying something new,
but it's often really fun and the gifts end up being a lot more special and
meaningful.
In this post,
I 'll be talking about a gift that I made for someone recently.

## It was a few weeks until Christmas...
...and I still hadn't come up with and idea for a cool gift to make for
my girlfriend.
I was getting worried that I wouldn't think of something and have enough
time to build it.
At the same time, I had been trying to come up with ideas for small web apps
that I could make for fun as excuses to learn new languages, techniques, and
frameworks.

One idea for a gift that I could make for her was a coupon book,
full of coupons for things I could do for her,
or activities that I could plan for us to do together.
The coupon book concept felt a little cheesy and clich√©,
but I was running out of time to plan something more involved.

Finally, I realized that I could combine these two things that I wanted to do
by making a coupon book, but also building a small web app to accompany it and
make it more unique.
This idea had the bonus of giving me something more practical than a quick
throwaway web app idea to build my skills with _and_ making my gift idea more
personalized than the standard coupon book idea.

## The Idea
In order to make the coupon book gift more interesting,
I decided to build an accompanying website that could be used both to read more
information about the coupons in the book and to redeem the coupons.
