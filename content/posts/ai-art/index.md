AI-generated artwork makes me sad.

This is not an unusual general sentiment, but I want to write about the specific
reason that AI artwork makes me sad because it's not something that I've seen
others write about.

Most of the AI art discourse I encounter is shortsighted.
People frequently dismiss AI artwork as aesthetically inferior to human artwork.
This may be true today, but it's clear that the systems generating the works are
rapidly improving.
I believe that they'll eventually be capable of consistently producing work that
is indistinguishable from the best human-made artwork.

Why does that make me sad?

Leo Tolstoy wrote that _"Art is not a handicraft, it is the transmission of
feeling the artist has experienced."_

I like that quote because the feeling of connection to the artist is a big part
of what makes my favorite art so enjoyable for me.

I feel this most deeply with music.
You don't need to be a skilled musician to hear a strong groove and feel some of
the same euphoria that the artist likely felt while recording it.
My favorite music makes me think about how much joy or heartbreak or excitement
or anger or fun the artist must have felt when they made it.

Today's AI-generated artwork is not typically good enough to trick me into that
sense of a connection to a human artist, but it will certainly get there.

That makes me sad because I expect it to change my relationship to new art that
I encounter.
If I'm unsure whether a piece of art was AI-generated, whether its a song or a
photograph or a video or something else, that uncertainty will be distracting
from the empathy I'd typically feel toward the artist.

I don't know what we can do about this.
Perfect labelling of AI-generated artwork could be a solution, but I'm not
optimistic that that's technically feasible.
Seeing artists live and in-person is a solution, but not a highly-scalable one.
