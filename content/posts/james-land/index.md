I've got a new website where I'm sharing sketches and experiments that would
normally never leave my computer: [james.land](https://james.land).

It's inspired by things like [Lu Wilson](https://www.todepond.com/)'s [tadi
web](https://www.tadiweb.com/style.html) and [talks about sharing
work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o) and by [Lars Doucet's Garbage
Fountain](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/operation-garbage-fountaion/).

The things I post there will be often be half-baked, unfinshed, an buggy. But
more importantly, they won't be stuck on my computer! They'll be out there for
others to play with, laugh at, fork, and respond to.
