  I used to read books all the time in Jr. High and High School,
  but when I started college,
  I stopped reading for myself as much as my readings and homework
  for classes started to pile up.
  Recently, I have been making reading a higher priority in my life.
  This page is a log of all the books that I read.

If you like this page,
you'll probably also like
[Susan Fowler's reading list](https://www.susanjfowler.com/reading-list/),
which is what inspired me to make one of my own.
