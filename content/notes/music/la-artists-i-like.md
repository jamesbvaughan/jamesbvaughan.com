title: LA Artists I Like
---

There are a bunch of musicians and bands that make up a sort of scene in LA
that I really like.
(Not all of them are necessarily from LA,
but they have a connection with this scene in some way.)
I enjoy finding the connections between all of them and plan to build a big
graph of these connections at some point.
