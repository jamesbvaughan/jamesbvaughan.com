title: favorite film moments
---
These are moments or scenes in movies that I like a lot.
They're not necessarily all from movies that I love,
but these specific scenes are great.

- **Hanna**: Long subway take
  - This is a really cool and well-choreographed long take
  that ends with a big fight.
- **Contact**: Mirror shot
- **Green Hornet**: Split screen sequence
  - In this scene, the screen keeps splitting into two and different characters
  are followed separately with different cameras.
  It looks really cool and I'm still not sure how it was done.
- **Children of Men**: Long car take & chaos take
  - This movie has quite a few cool scenes, but these two long takes are
  my favorites.
- **Vertigo**: Dream sequence & the kiss
- **Betty Boop**: Cab Calloway song and dance sequences
  - These scenes were some of the first examples of rotoscoping and
  I really love the animation in them.
- **10 Cloverfield Lane**: Opening Credit Car Crash
  - I just think this is a great opening sequence
- **Raw**: Finger scene
  - If you've seen Raw, you probably know what scene I'm talking about.
  Something intense and significant happens and the visuals and the soundtrack
  for the scene are all just great.
- **Suspira**: dance torture scene
  - This scene is pretty disturbing but also really cool. Amanda showed me a behind the scenes video on it that was also really cool.
