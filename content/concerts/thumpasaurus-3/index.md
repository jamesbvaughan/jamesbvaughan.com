Day Ghost was really good!

# Thumpasaurus

This is the fourth time I've seen Thumpasaurus live, and it was great as
always, but they were missing the keyboard player, and I felt like they
were lower energy than the other times I've seen them.

The venue was smaller than the other places I've seen and it did make it more
intimate in a cool way.
