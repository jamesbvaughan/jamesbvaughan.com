# Opener: Flaccid Mojo

I'm not sure what to call their music. I don't think most people liked it, and
I wouldn't want to listen to it regularly but I did really like it.

I like Panda Bear's music a lot, but the concert wasn't really my style.
I really prefer bands to one man shows that rely heavily on projected visuals.
It was definitly cool and I enjoyed it a lot, but I would have prefered to see
more instruments and people playing them on stage.
