This show was fairly similar to their set at Treasure Island.
They sound pretty good live, but I wish it was a bit easier to hear the guitars
and keyboards. For most of the show, it was difficult to match what I saw with
what I heard.

Other than that, it was great! The audience was very hyped for the whole show,
and it was clear that everyone was having a great time.
