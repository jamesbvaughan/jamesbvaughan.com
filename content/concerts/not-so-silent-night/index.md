This was a long time ago and I don't remember it super well, but I'll do my
best.

# Bastille

We arrived partway through this set and I really don't remember it at all.

# Lorde

Something was wrong with Lorde's mic at the beginning of her set, and I
remember thinking she handled it kind of awkwardly.

I had never seen a performance like that one before, where it's pretty much
only the singer on stage, with maybe a musician or two that are not well
lit and staying out of the singer's way. (Now I know that a lot of pop music
is like this live.)

# Alt-J

I do remember really liking Alt-J and thinking they had cool percussion.

# Phoenix

I loved Phoenix. They were one of my favorite bands and definitely what I
was most excited about.

# Arcade Fire

We left after the first song because the people I was with didn't want to
get home too late :(
