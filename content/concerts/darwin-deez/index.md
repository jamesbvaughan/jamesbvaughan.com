![Darwin Deez](darwin-deez.jpg)

I loved this show.
I had been listening to Darwin Deez since high school, but only
occasionally, and I wasn't very familiar with his newer music,
but it was still a lot of fun.

Darwin is an incredibly entertaining performer, and a great
musician and songwriter.
He's definitely an artist that I'll try to see anytime he's in
town now.
