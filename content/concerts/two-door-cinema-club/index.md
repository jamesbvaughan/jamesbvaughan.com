## Opener: Pacific Air

I really liked Pacific Air and still listen to them occasionally.
They broke up a long time ago,
but some of the band have released newer music under the name "Mating Ritual".

## Two Door Cinema Club

This was a really special concert for me because it Two Door was probably
my favorite band at the time,
and I went to this concert with a group of guys that have since become my
best friends.
