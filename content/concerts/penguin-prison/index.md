## Penguin Prison

Penguin Prison performed a DJ set at this block party before the
Launch Music Festival in Sacramento.
I went with Mark and we watched the whole set, plus a couple of
bands.

The only thing I remember from the set is that he played an early
version of his collaboration with RAC, Hollywood, before it was
released, and I thought that was really cool.
