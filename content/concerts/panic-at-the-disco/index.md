I was pleasantly surprised by this concert.
I've never been a big _Panic!_ fan, but this was definitely entertaining.
I appreciated that there was a full band (complete with brass and strings
sections), and that there were some pretty impressive theatrical stunts,
like a floating piano hovering above the audience for a couple songs:

I still have a hard time feeling like it's worth it to pay nearly 10 times
as much for a big stadium concert like this as I would for a small show
for one of my favorite bands, and then after paying that much more, to be
nearly a quarter mile away from the stage, but this one defintely seemed
to put that money to good use.
