## Opener: Walk the Moon

I only caught the very end of this, but I really liked it and wish that I
had been able to see the full set.

## Thirty Seconds To Mars

Amanda *loves* Thirty Seconds to Mars so it was inevitable that she take
me to one of their concerts eventually.
I liked it overall, but wish that I could have seen more of a full band
during the show.
