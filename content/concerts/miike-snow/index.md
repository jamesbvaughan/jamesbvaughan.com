## Miike Snow

This was a great concert.
I had been a Miike Snow fan for a long time, but had never had a chance
to see them, so when a friend of mine was selling tickets that she
couldn't use anymore, I didn't hesitate to buy them off her.

The show didn't dissapoint.
This was after their latest album, *iii*, came out and it was super
cool to see those songs live.
They had a big brass section and it totally changed the feel of a lot of
the songs in a cool way.

I didn't get any pictures of the concert, but I did take this picture
of some cotton candy ice cream that Amanda and I got before the show.
