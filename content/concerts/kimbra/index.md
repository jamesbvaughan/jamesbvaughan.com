## Opener: Spencer Zahn

Spencer Zahn opened this show with a minimal instrumental set featuring
just a piano, a stand up bass, and a small Eurorack modular synthesizer.

I had just attended an electronic music open mic the night before called
[Resonant Frequencies](https://www.facebook.com/thresfreq)
that primarily featuring modular synthesizers.
That event had an incredibly broad range of music, from nearly unlistenable
noise art to head banging 90s house.

Coming from Resonant Frequencies the night before,
it was really refreshing to hear the modular synth used in such a pleasant and
beautiful way during Zahn's set.
I enjoyed it a lot, and especially enjoyed how clearly I could hear everything.
The past few shows I've gone to have been so loud that the music gets so
muddled with the sound of the room and people in the audience yelling over it
that it's hard to really appreciate the music.
This show was unique in that the entire audience was silent and Zahn was able
to play _quietly_, in a good way.

I'd highly recommend his album, which you can find on Spotify
[here](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Mo6aBU1RSDBj1spvgfIao?si=nL_zeftwRtSfdBdeNpo7cg).

## Kimbra

This show was advertised as "An Intimate, Reimagined Evening",
bringing the stripped down sound of her recent EP:
_Songs from Primal Heart: Reimagined_ to a live setting.
I haven't seen Kimbra's usual live show, but from what I understand,
this was very different than what she usually does,
and it was great.

Kimbra had Spencer Zahn on the stand up bass and had a pianist whose name
I've forgotten unfortunately.
She didn't play any instruments herself for this show,
but did have some crazy cool and well-timed vocal effects that someone must
have been working hard on behind the scenes.

I really appreciate when artists show their personality during a show,
and Kimbra definitely did at this one.
The Chapel is a rad venue, but it's not a large one by any means.
I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to see Kimbra perform at
a place like that.

I'm looking forward to seeing what her shows are usually like someday!
