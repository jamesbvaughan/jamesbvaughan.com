description: A list of new features that I'd like to have in a variety of products and services.

I often run into situations where I wish that a product or service that
I'm using had a certain feature.
In this page, I document those features.

# Websites and Apps

## [Spotify](https://spotify.com)

- A way to sort my saved albums by release date.
  - There's [a Spotify Community post about this](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Sort-by-release-date/idi-p/381502), but it's closed and doesn't seem like there's going to be any work on this anytime soon.
  - I suspect that a major difficulty here is that their date metadata for a lot of releases is not any more granular than year, so sorting within a year would be difficult, not to mention releases that had different release dates in different regions. 
    - [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release_Group) attempts to solve this problem by separating the concepts of a "Release" and a "Release Group".

- A way to send recommendations to friends and see all the recommendations you've been sent in a single place in the Spotify apps.

## [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com)

- An option to hide a specific movie's ratings and reviews
  - Sometimes I'd like to watch a movie without knowing what anyone else thought of it, and that information can be hard to avoid if it's a popular movie.

- More complex search queries
  - I'd like to be able to get things like a list of all movies on the [Letterboxd Top 250 list](https://letterboxd.com/dave/list/official-top-250-narrative-feature-films/) that are also on the [Best Picture Winners list](https://letterboxd.com/jake_ziegler/list/academy-award-winners-for-best-picture/) the neither I or specific friends of mine on Letterboxd have seen.

## [Facebook Messenger for Web](https://messenger.com)

- Dark mode
  - The mobile and desktop apps have it! Why not web too?

## [Twitter](https://twitter.com)

- A way to hide everything but tweets from people I've chosen to follow.
  - I found [this list of terms to mute](https://gist.github.com/IanColdwater/88b3341a7c4c0cf71c73ac56f9bd36ec) which can clean up the timeline, but it doesn't work across apps, and it seems like Twitter will make it stop working soon if they haven't already.
  - I know that there are third party apps that can get me the clean timeline that I want, but I actually _like_ using the official Twitter interface except for a few nits like this.

## The "TV" app on Apple TV

- This app aggregates movies and tv shows from various providers (Hulu, iTunes, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, etc.) into a clean and unified interface, but does not include content from Netflix and I wish it did.
  - I found [a discussion on Reddit about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/atpa4t/how_do_i_add_netflix_activity_to_the_tv_app/) where some other folks wrote about wanting this feature. I'm not sure if it's blocked by something on Apple's end or on Netflix's, but I hope they work it out eventually.

## Netlify Analytics

- I'd like to have access to more than 30 days of historical data. For a paid analytics solution, this limitation is particularly frustrating.
  - There's a bit of discussion about this [on the Netlify community forum](https://community.netlify.com/t/historical-analytics-data-more-than-30-days/26466).
