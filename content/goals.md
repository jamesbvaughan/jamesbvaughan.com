title: Thoughts on Goals
draft: true
---

This post is intended as a question about how to think about life goals,
not an answer to that question.

I tend to set a lot of goals for myself.
Many of them center around
[mastering different skills](/skills),
but some of them are a bit more broad, especially the larger ones.

# My Goals

At the time of this writing, these are a few of the larger personal goals on my
mind.

## Family: Have a happy family

I was talking to a friend recently who has been thinking about this topic and
was grilling me on it a bit.
He asked me about my biggest goal in life and the answer that felt most
natural to me was that I want to someday have a spouse and children that I
love and that love me.
I said that I'm happy to wait quite a while to achieve this goal so that I can
spend time now focusing on other goals, but that that was the one goal that
I think I would be most sad if I never achieved.

## Research: Contribute to developments in HCI or our understanding of learning

I recently got to see Bret Victor talk about the work going on at
[Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) and
[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) talk about his research on the way
people think and learn.
Both were incredibly inspiring and really made me feel like the work they were
doing was important and exciting.
I don't have any formal background in these areas, but their talks got me
excited enough that I felt like I could reasonably consider devoting all my
energy to contributing toward their research.

## Career: Have a large impact on my company's mission and progress as an engineer

Stripe recently held its end-of-the-year all-company gathering, which was full
of entertaining and inspiring talks about the work we did in 2019 and our goals
for 2020.

These talks felt like they were written with the intention to inspire us to feel
energized and excited about the work that Stripe is doing and eager to 
continue contributing to Stripe's mission,
and they were very successful in having that effect on me.

I came away from them really feeling like helping push Stripe forward is the
best way that I can use my skills to have a positive impact on the world.

## Art: Create art that inspires and moves other people

I spend a lot of time listening to music, and when I listen to some of my
favorite albums, I get so swept up in awe of the music that all I want to do is
spend time practicing practicing music and writing songs so that I can try to
make music like that too.

# Why am I writing this?

I get really excited thinking about any one of these goals, but thinking about
more than one of them can leave me a bit overwhelmed.
It's not that I think they are all mutually exclusive, but it's hard to imagine
ever being able to devote as much time to more than one of them than I would
really like to# Why am I writing this?
