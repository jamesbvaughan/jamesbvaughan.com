This was an homage to [teenage engineering's _field desk_](https://teenage.engineering/products/field-desk).

I wrote [a longer post about it](/meadow-desk),
describing the motivation and the build process in more depth.

I also built [a configuration tool](https://tweenage.engineering/meadow-desk/configure)
where you can design your own.
