# stripe

I've been working at
[Stripe](https://stripe.com)
for about a year and a half now and  is been great so far. I work on infrastructure on the _Compute_ team.
I get to work on interesting problems with very talented people.
(And in case you're interested,
[we're hiring](https://stripe.com/jobs) ðŸ˜‰.)

# making music

There are [lots of things](http://localhost:1313/skills-in-progress/) that I
like spending my outside-of-work time doing,
but the most important one for me right now is making music.
I've mostly been practicing guitar, piano, and drums, but have also started
recording some things to push myself to work on songwriting and composing.

I recently began posting some recordings
[on Instagram](https://instagram.com/jamesmakessounds).
I was nervous to post those publicly at first, since I want to make things
perfect before I share them and don't feel like I have the skills to make
things perfect yet, but it's been a good motivator for me and has pushed me to
actually finish small pieces and start showing them to friends.

# exploring san francisco

I've been living in San Francisco for about a year and a half now,
and I love going for walks and finding new places to enjoy and things to look
at.

I especially like going to parks with nice views and finding intersections at
the top of hills where you can look down and follow a street to the edge of
the city.
