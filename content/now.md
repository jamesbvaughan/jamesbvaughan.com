# working

I recently passed 2 years at [Arcol](https://arcol.io) and I'm more excited
about it than ever.
I get to work on interesting and challenging problems with coworkers that I
admire.
(We're hiring! [Email me](mailto:james@arcol.io) if you're interested.)

# climbing, slacklining, and running

After a multi-year streak of struggling to maintain a regular exercise routine,
I've finally got one to stick.
I'm climbing twice a week, running 2-3 times a week, and getting together with
some slackliners in Berkeley every Thursday evening.

# playing music

Sadly, this has taken the backseat compared to the other two items on this list
lately.
I'm still spending some time practicing piano and guitar, but not enough to feel
like I'm making much progress.
