# playing music

I've mostly been practicing guitar, piano, and drums, but have also started
recording some things to push myself to work on songwriting and composing.

I recently began posting some recordings
[on Instagram](https://instagram.com/jamesmakessounds).
I was nervous to post those publicly at first, since I want to make things
perfect before I share them and don't feel like I have the skills to make
things perfect yet, but it's been a good motivator for me and has pushed me to
actually finish small pieces and start showing them to friends.

# thinking about software and people

I read [Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen's paper on tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)
last year and it's had a huge influence on my interests since then.
I'm fascinated by the idea that new transformative tools for thought could
(and hopefully will) be developed.
I've had fun continuing to explore this topic and learn more about the
people that are actively working on it.
