This page is a sort of public bookmark list for links to things on the internet
that I've found interesting or valuable. 

# Movies

- [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) - This site is a must-use for movie
  lovers. It makes it easy to keep track of movies you've seen and want to see.

# Music

## Listening To Music

- [Discogs](https://discogs.com) - This site is primarily for vinyl lovers, but
  I've found that it gives me some of the same features for music that I like
  about Letterboxd for movies, like making lists of albums and looking up who
  all was involved in the making of an album.

- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) - Bandcamp is my favorite music discovery
  platform and my favorite place to buy digital and physical music. They seem
  to treat artists more better than other platforms do, and provide a simple
  way for them to sell their music. When you purchase digital music there,
  you have unlimited downloads of high-quality DRM-free files.

- [Last.fm](https://last.fm) - This one has been around for a long time, and I
  wish more people that I knew used it because I think it's really cool. It
  tracks the songs you listen to across all of your different streaming services
  and music apps, and gives you cool stats from your listening history.

## Learning Music

- [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) - This is a cool website
  that folks at Ableton made that aims to help people learn the basics of what
  goes in to making music.

- [Learning Synths](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/) - This is pretty
  similar to Learning Music, but focused specifically on learning synthesis.
  I think it's a great way for people to learn this stuff without having to
  buy a hardware synth or figure out how to use potentially confusing VSTs.

- [Justin Guitar](https://www.justinguitar.com/) - This site has so much good
  free content for learning guitar, it's crazy. Justin is a great teacher,
  and I've gotten a lot of value from his videos.

- [Jim Pankey's Banjo Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLimF2H1ED8fXabeFAr6Fnslf0ie6TRUL0) -
  I've been going through this guy's videos while I'm borrowing my brother's
  banjo and they've been great. I wish there were videos like Jim's for every
  skill I've wanted to learn.

- [ModularGrid](https://www.modulargrid.net) - If you're interested in Eurorack
  modular synthesizers and haven't been using this site, I'm not sure if I want
  to recommend it or tell you to avoid it, because it's way too easy to get
  excited about new modules on it and convince yourself to spend more money
  than you should.

- [Funklet](http://funklet.com/) - This is a collection of some of the funkiest
  drum grooves of all time, curated by Jack Stratton of Vulfpeck. I've found it
  to be super helpful when looking for groove inspiration.

# Programming

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Netlify provides a set of tools that
  make it easy to build websites with little-to-no backend code. I use it to
  host this website (which it rebuilds automatically with every new commit to
  master), to host a few "Serverless" functions for it, and to collect
  server-side-only analytics so that I don't have to send you any javascript
  tracking junk when you visit this site.

# Social

- [Couchsurfing](https://couchsurfing.com) - This one had been on my radar for
  a long time but I didn't start using it until this year. Since joining, I've
  hosted about a dozen travelers from all over the world at my place and it's
  been a lot of fun. Some people get pretty sketched out by the concept of
  letting strangers stay in your home, but I think you can minimize the risk
  by checking up on people's social media profiles before offering to host them,
  and reading through their reviews from previous hosts.

# People

These are some personal websites that I think are cool or inspiring.
Some belong to friends of mine and some belong to people that I don't know
personally but admire.

- [Corbin Muraro](https://corbinmuraro.com) - I like how simple Corbin's site
  is while still having the information that most people will be looking for.

- [Devon Zuegel](https://devonzuegel.com/) - I like the quality of Devon's
  posts and also the idea of publishing
  [_half-baked_](https://devonzuegel.com/tag/half-baked) ideas and posts.

- [Jenn Schiffer](http://jennmoney.biz/) - I just love Jenn's style and think
  she works on really rad stuff (like [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)!)

- [Seena Burns](http://seenaburns.com/) - I like Seena's colorscheme and his
  use of images and GIFs that show you what you're reading about.

- [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/) - I love the content on
  Patrick's site (like his
  [list of interesting questions](https://patrickcollison.com/)
  or his
  [list of impressively fast projects](https://patrickcollison.com/fast))
  but I do wish it had just a bit more styling to make it nicer to navigate and
  read on mobile.

- [Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/) - I think Nadia has done some really
  interesting work, and she also has
  [a page with some rough/half-baked ideas](https://nadiaeghbal.com/notes/).

- [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) - I think that Andy's
  [work related to learning and memory](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)
  is fascinating, and the columned layout of his site is pretty unique.

- [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/) - Drew makes some impressive
  software (most notably for me, [sway](https://swaywm.org/)) and I like that
  he posts monthly status updates about all of the work that he's doing.
  (He also believes strongly enough in the importance of personal
  blogs/websites that he'll
  [give you $20 if you make one](https://drewdevault.com/make-a-blog)!)

- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) - I like Julia's writing a lot, and she also
  writes [zines](https://wizardzines.com/) to help people learn about systems
  and Linux!

- [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) - Derek has done some amazing work,
  written books, and has some inspiring website ideas, like
  [now pages](https://nownownow.com/about)
  ([his](https://sivers.org/now), [mine](/now)).
