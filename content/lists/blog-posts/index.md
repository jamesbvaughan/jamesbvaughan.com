I read a lot of blog posts and articles online, and it's one of my favorite
mediums for reading and writing.
I generally discover new blogs through Reddit or Hacker News, and when I read
something that I like, I'll usually add it to my RSS reader so that I can keep
up with new posts.

I often see people romanticizing the blogging culture of the
late-90s/early-2000s internet, and I don't doubt that we could be missing some
things from that time,
but I think that today's blogging culture is alive and well.
There are some great writers regularly putting out fantastic content.
Here are some of my favorite posts I've read.
