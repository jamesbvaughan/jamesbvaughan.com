I watch a lot of movies.
If you want to track every single movie I watch,
you can do that on
[my Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/jamesbvaughan/films/).
If you are just interested in knowing what my favorite movies are,
then you're in the right place.

### My favorite movies

I'd like to preface this section by saying that I make a distinction between
what I believe to be the "best" movies and what are my "favorite" movies.
To give an example, I believe that Forrest Gump is one of the best movies
ever made, and I love it, but it's not one of my favorite movies.
