I think podcasts are really cool.
You can listen to them and learn or be entertained or both in a lot of
situations where you can't easily read a book or do real work.
I spend a lot of time walking, which makes for a lot of time to listen to
podcasts.

### My favorite podcasts

I try to maintain a balance of podcasts that teach me new and interesting things
and podcasts that are mostly entertainment.
I'm always open to recommendations for more, so let me know what your favorites
are!
