  hey i'm james<br />
  welcome to my website<br />
  Hey! My name is James Vaughan and I live in California and study computer
  science at UCLA.
  I'm usually out slacklining and climbing, but sometimes I take pictures,
  go to class, and write code.
  I also read books and watch a lot of movies
  <span id="movie"></span>
  and I'm almost always listening to music<span id="song"></span>.

I've been spending most of my time lately playing with Linux,
learning new programming languages, and building websites.
One of the thing that excites me the most about computers is the potential for
improved educational materials that make use of interactive visualizations
and explanations that can help learners understand and develop intuition about
the world around them.
