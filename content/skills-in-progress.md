# skills in progress

One thing that helps me stay happy and energized is to always be working to
improve a skill.
There are *a lot* that I would like to be working on, but I've found that I
have more success when I limit myself to just a few at a time.

## current

These are the things I'm currently spending a lot of my free time practicing:

- Guitar and Banjo
- Mindfulness
- Climbing

## backlog

These are some things that I practice every once in a while,
but haven't been prioritizing over my other interests yet:

- Drums
- Singing
- Drawing
- More advanced juggling
- Unicycling
- Cooking
- Spanish
- Handstands

## back-backlog

These are things that I have zero experience with but would love to learn about
if I had an infinite amount of free time:

- 3D Modeling and Animation
- Drawing
- Live sound
- Any brass/wind instrument
- A new spoken language
