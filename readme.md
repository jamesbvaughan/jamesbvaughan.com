# jamesbvaughan.com This is the source code for my personal website. You can see
the site [here](https://jamesbvaughan.com). ## Development I don't make changes
to my site very frequently, so documenting the development process a bit really
helps when I can't remember how certain things are supposed to work. ###
Deploying Changes Just commit and push, and Cloudflare pages will handle the
rest.
