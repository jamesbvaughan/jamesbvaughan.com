This is the source code for my personal website.
You can see the site [here](https://jamesbvaughan.com).

## Development

I don't make changes to my site very frequently,
so documenting the development process a bit really helps when I can't
remember how certain things are supposed to work.

### Deploying Changes

Just commit and push, and Netlify will handle the rest and should email you if
anything goes wrong with the deployment.
