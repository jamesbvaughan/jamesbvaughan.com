title: College Advice I Would Give My Freshman Self
---

As I approach the end of my undergraduate years at UCLA,
I've been spending some time reflecting on the things I've learned and the
improvements that I have made to my workflows for classes, coding,
and college life in general.

There are a handful of things that I have learned and processes I have optimized
for myself that I would love to have learned or optimized earlier on in college.

In this post, I will catalog some of these things in the hope that they will
help out students getting started on their journey through college.
Some are directed at Computer Science students specifically,
and some are directed at UCLA students specifically,
but many of them are applicable to students in any major at any school.

## Class Advice
- Read textbooks
- Go to office hours
- Experiment w/ note taking systems to find the best one for you
- Plan so that you can have an easy final quarter/semester

#### Sit In The Front

I've found sitting in or near the front of class to have a few different
benefits:
- It makes it harder to get distracted on your phone or computer
  because the professor can clearly tell if you do.
- It makes it easier to hear and understand the professor and to read the
blackboard or slides.
- The professor will get to know your face, and will remember that you
  pay attention and sit in the front when she is grading your exams and papers.
  I suspect that this can have positive effects on your grades

Sitting in the front is especially nice during exams:
- There are almost always a bunch of open seats in the front during exams.
- The professor/TAs probably won't suspect you of cheating
  since you can't see other people's exams.
- You'll have way more legroom in classrooms with tightly packed desks.
- You won't have to squeeze past anyone when you get up to turn in your exam.


## Coding Advice
- Learn about:
  - git
  - Linux
  - command line
- Find an area you enjoy:
  - learn about it in free time
  - do personal project:
    - great for interviews
    - github resume

## College Life Advice
- Use a calendar app
  - use shared calendars for closest friends/partners
  - use shared calendars for student groups
  - make an "interesting classes" calendar
- Make deep friendships:
  - sep interview style hangouts
- Sleep
