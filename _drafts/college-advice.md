title: College Advice I Would Give My Freshman Self
---

As I approach the end of my undergraduate years at UCLA,
I've been spending some time reflecting on the things I've learned and the
improvements that I have made to my workflows for classes, coding,
and college life in general.

There are a handful of things that I have learned and processes I have optimized
for myself that I would love to have learned or optimized earlier on in college.

In this post, I will catalog some of these things in the hope that they will
help out students getting started on their journey through college.
Some are directed at Computer Science students specifically,
and some are directed at UCLA students specifically, but
many of them are applicable to students in any major at any school.

## Class Advice

### Sit In The Front

I've found sitting in or near the front of class to have a few different
benefits:

- It makes it harder to get distracted on your phone or computer
  because the professor can clearly tell if you do.
- It makes it easier to hear and understand the professor and to read the
  blackboard or slides.
- The professor will get to know your face, and will remember that you
  pay attention and sit in the front when she is grading your exams and papers.
  I suspect that this can have positive effects on your grades

Sitting in the front is especially nice during exams:

- There are almost always a bunch of open seats in the front during exams.
- The professor/TAs probably won't suspect you of cheating
  since you can't see other people's exams.
- You'll have way more legroom in classrooms with tightly packed desks.
- You won't have to squeeze past anyone when you get up to turn in your exam.

### Read Your Textbooks

Some people are naturally pretty good at doing this.
Personally, I found it difficult to be motivated to keep up with all the
readings for my classes early in college, but as time went on,
I found that doing the assigned readings _before_ the lectures on those
readings has a tremendous impact on how much I get out of lectures.
The readings give me a good baseline understanding of the material,
and then the lecture helps fill in all the gaps and drill in the key points.

### Go to Office Hours

This is pretty common advice for college freshman,
and it's something I heard all the time, but was
really slow to actually start doing.
As someone who is not naturally inclined to attend office hours,
I can tell you that I have never regretted going and have been really glad
that I chose to go every single time that I have.
Even if you don't have specific questions to ask about,
office hours are a great time to listen to the questions that other students
bring that you might not have even thought to ask,
as well as a great time to get to know your professors better,
and if you go to a big school like UCLA,
you won't get to know your professors well unless you are very intentional
about it.

### Learn to Take Good Notes

This is something that I struggled with for a long time.
I've tried a whole bunch of different note taking systems and techniques
and never took notes that were truly useful to me until I settled on a system
that was really natural for me.

For me, that system involves taking notes on my computer in Markdown in Vim,
and then converting them to PDFs and HTML pages using Pandoc.
This system works well for me, but would be horrible for most people.
Experiment with a variety of systems until you find out what's best for you
and then stick with it.
Here are a few ideas in case you'd like some:

- pencil and paper
- colored pens and paper
- plain text files
- Evernote
- Google Docs
- audio recordings

In addition to experimenting with different systems,
experiment with what kind of notes you take.
Some people just copy down what's on the professor's slides word-for-word.
(This has always struck me as a strange technique because it makes it hard to
pay attention to the lecture and the slides are often posted online anyway.)
Others write down every word that the professor says.
I know some people that take notes when they do their readings before lecture
and then annotate those notes with any new information from the lecture.
Find out what feels right for you.

### Give Yourself a Light Final Quarter/Semester

I planned my schedule such that my final quarter was the lightest one
(as far as number of classes goes) of all my quarters at UCLA.
It's turned out to be a great decision and I would advise anyone else who
is able to to do the same.

## Coding Advice

This section has advice for any students who are into programming,
whether or not they're majoring in Computer Science or a related field.

### Learn To Use Common Tools

There are a number of tools commonly used in software development that are
essential for developers to learn about.
The sooner you build up some familiarity with these tools, the better.
They will make many coding homework assignments way easier,
they will supercharge your personal projects,
and they will be indispensable during any software engineering internships
you may have.

#### Git

Git is a version control system that tracks changes you make to your code.
There is so much to git that you will probably never stop learning more
about it, but for now you just need to know that
it provides a nice workflow for collaborating on software projects
and you can use it as a way to back up changes you make to personal projects
and coding homework assignments.

[This guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
is a good introduction to git's basic features.

#### The Unix Command Line

Being comfortable with the command line is a must when it comes to writing
software (in my opinion).
Over time, you will find that many common tasks related to programming are
considerably faster and more clear when performed from the command line.

(If you're weird like me, you might even end up liking it so much that you
start doing everything from managing your filesystem to checking your email
to reading the news to browsing Reddit from the terminal).

#### Linux

This one isn't strictly necessary, but for me,
using Linux has led me to so many cool areas of computing and
been my introduction to all of my favorite and most commonly used software.
Many students get by with little more than a basic surface-level familiarity
with Linux, but if you find that you enjoy it, it can be really useful.
On top of that, the skills that you will inevitably pick up through
long-term Linux usage will likely help you understand a lot of aspects of
software development on a deeper level.

### Find Something You Enjoy

My friends who have been most successful in CS are those that found
a topic within computing that fascinates them and then dove deep into that
topic.
For some, that topic is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
For others, it's mobile development.
For me, it was Linux and open-source.

Once you find something that you really enjoy,
set aside some time every week to learn more about it.
(Ideally you would enjoy it enough that you don't need to be told to do that.)
Watch videos, read articles and blog posts, and work on personal projects
related to that thing.
This can be really fun,
and can also make for great conversation topics when interviewing for
jobs and internships.

## College Life Advice

This section has general college advice that can really apply to anyone.

### Use A Calendar

Making heavy use of a structured calendar has been a central part of my life
over the past four years.
I honestly don't know how I could have gotten through without it.
I've gone through different phases of calendar use,
from OCD-level use where I put every single thing I do on my calendar,
from sleep to homework to brushing my teeth,
to more relaxed use where I only put things on my calendar that are
strictly tied to specific dates and times.
Both of those levels worked for me at the times that I was using them, but
the constant thing has been some form of a calendar to keep track of what
I need to do.

#### Find The Right Calendar For You

This is becoming a common theme in this post, but I really think that
you need to experiment with a few different calendars
to find out what you like the most.
For some people that's a personal planner notebook with a paper calendar inside
it, and for others it's the calendar app on their phone.
For me, it's been Google Calendar.
Having a thorough schedule synchronized between my phone and computer is a must
for me, and Google Calendar does a great job of that.

#### Use Shared Calendars

Shared calendars are great and I only started using them heavily this year.
They are great for student groups where you need to keep a large number of
people up to date on the details of upcoming events, but
they are also useful on a smaller scale.
For example,
my girlfriend and I keep a shared calendar where we add anything that we are
going to be doing together.
This saves us the work of adding things to both of our calendars and helps us
avoid errors where one of us adds an event to the wrong time or date.

#### Make An "Interesting Classes" Calendar

This is an idea that I have only started to implement this quarter, but
it's something I wish I had started at the very beginning of college.
The concept is simple:
Make a calendar in whatever calendar app you use that includes all of the
classes in a given quarter or semester that sound interesting to you that
you probably won't ever actually enroll in.
Then, whenever you are on campus and have some free time,
you can toggle on this calendar and see if there are any classes coming up
that you can go sit in on and listen to the lecture in.
(Don't forget to add the locations of each class to the calendar events
so that you don't have to look them up each time!)

### Prioritize Relationships

I'm not just talking about romantic relationships here.
You need to prioritize *all* of the relationships you develop during college.
The closer I get to graduating,
the more I've realized that the most valuable things I've gotten from my time
here are the relationships I've developed with people.

I am in a co-ed entrepreneurship fraternity at UCLA and one of my favorite
things about the fraternity is our "interview" system:
All new members are required to attempt to "interview" every single existing
member.
These interviews simply consist of hanging out one-on-one with that person
for 2 to 3 hours and getting to know them.
I love these interviews because it provides a great way to really get to know
people and start to build friendships with them.
Having a designated time like this to be really intentional about getting to
know someone is a unique situation that I wish more people got to experience.
Sometimes these friendships don't go much farther than surface-level, but
a surprisingly high percentage of them turn into very genuine and deep
relationships.

If you are not a part of a student group like this,
there is nothing stopping you from trying the same thing.
You will just have to be more self-directed about it.
Take a look at your social circles and start inviting individuals to go to
breakfast or lunch or to just go for a walk with you.
Some people might think this is strange at first, but
I am confident that neither of you will regret it afterward.

### Sleep

I didn't take sleep as seriously as I should have until this year.
For most of college, I was staying up until sometime between midnight
and 3 a.m., and then sleeping in until sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m..
To make things worse,
I would often procrastinate homework assignments and studying for exams until
the night before and then stay up late studying or finishing the assignment.

Recently, I've started trying to turn myself into more of a morning person
and let me tell you, it feels _so_ much better than going to bed late and
waking up late.

I've taken a bit of an extreme approach to this by most people's standards
and have been trying to get in bed between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. and then waking up
at 5 a.m..
I've shifted most of the work that I used to do at night to the mornings
and for me, this feels way more productive.
Where I was constantly distracted by Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube late at
night, I am able to stay focused way more when I do work in the mornings.

When I talk to friends about this,
they often ask me about my morning routine and as for tips on getting up that
early.
I don't have a super strict morning routine, but I have found a few things
that seem to help me get out of bed and stay out of bed in the mornings:

- Don't use your phone or computer in bed before you go to sleep.
- Have a clear idea of what you are going to do in the morning.
- Drink a glass of water right when you get up.
- Turn the lights on.
- Do some quick push-ups or pull-ups or go for a short jog.

I don't think that these are necessarily the right tips for everybody,
nor do I think that waking up as early as I do will necessarily make all
other people more productive.
Every person is different, but these are the things that work for me.
